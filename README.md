# Alpha - eCommerce Developer Track | Pixel-Perfect Landing Page Test

Welcome to my submission for the Alpha Developer Track challenge. This project is a pixel-perfect front-end clone of the [Sculptique](https://trysculptique.com/products/lymph-cc-select) landing page, demonstrating practical UI construction skills, code structuring, and real-world problem-solving abilities.

📂 **Source Code:** [\[Repository\]](https://github.com/ChuPhanNhatLong-SE183738/pati-landingpage)

## 🎯 Project Goals

Following the assessment requirements, the primary goals of this project are:

1.  **Pixel-Perfect UI:** Accurately reproducing the layout, spacing, typography (Lora & Nunito fonts), and color palette of the original reference page.
2.  **Responsiveness:** Ensuring a seamless experience across all devices (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile), with a focus on adapting complex layouts from single-column (mobile) to grid-based (desktop).
3.  **Clean Code & Structure:** Building a maintainable, readable, and component-based architecture.
4.  **Interactions:** Implementing UI states such as hover effects, carousels (Video Stories), and accordions (FAQs).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The project is built using a modern stack to ensure performance and developer experience:

- **Core:** React (Vite)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Custom configuration for brand colors and typography).
- **Icons:** Lucide React / SVG (Sourced from the reference for accuracy).
- **Slider/Carousel:** Swiper.js (For smooth touch interactions in the Video Stories section).
